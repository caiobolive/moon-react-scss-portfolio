# My Moon Portfolio

My intention with this project is to show off some front-end skills, design and also keep the website satisfying to use.

In this project I pushed the parallax effect to its limit by using overlapped videos instead of images. Another front-end trend that I implemented was glassmorphism, the glass-like appearance of some elements background.

There are 5 pages: Intro, About, Skills, Projects and Experiences and all of them present a different layout and parallax video for show

The project is fully responsive and made with React, Vite, SCSS, and deployed on AWS with Route 53 and Cloudfront

Here is the website Link: https://caiobolive.com.br

Here are some of its features:
